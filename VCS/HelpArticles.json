    "Body": "To award an open shift by an employee, follow these steps: Log into the Web Portal with a Supervisor level account. Click on Supervisor. In the Open Shifts submenu, click on Award Open Shifts by Employee. The Award Open Shifts by Employee screen will appear The screen will default to reflect either Simple Rules, Advanced Rules, or an option to change between both. Please note that this setting is modified in the Site Content screen by the Administrator of your department. Advanced Rules If using Advanced Rules (as set up by your department), the advanced rules should either appear on the screen, or you can select the Advanced Rules option if you have access to both options. In the Dates section, use the date pickers to select a date range that contains open shift assignments and employee signups. In the Rule Group drop-down menu, select the Replacement Policy Group to run for this process. Click on Find Now once you have set the appropriate criteria. Simple Rules If using Simple Rules (as set up by your department) the simple rules should either appear on the screen, or you can select the Simple Rules option if you have access to both options. In the Dates section, use the date pickers to select a date range that contains open shift assignments and employee signups. In the Employee List drop-down menu, select the employee list to run for this process. In the Sort By section, select the sorting option to run against the selected employee list. The following define the available sorting options: Overtime Sort # will sort the employee list by the overtime sort order created in the employee list. Seniority will sort the employee list by the seniority number assigned to each employee in the employee list Total Overtime Worked will sort the employee list by the number of total overtime hours worked by each employee. Callbacks, Orderbacks, Holdovers, and Orderover refer to specific sort orders created in the Employee List Properties screen. These sorts were mostly used in older versions of the system and may not be used by all departments. Naming employee list properties with these terms and then selecting them to sort will use the created employee list property rules to sort the selected employee list. Click on Find Now once you have set the appropriate criteria. The Replacement Policy screen will appear with the specified search criteria. The top banner will define the number of open shift assignments available to fill within the selected date range. The # of Full Signups and # of Partial Signups columns will represent the number of full or partial assignments that the employee has signed up for. Please note that this number does not represent the number of assignments that the employee qualifies for, only the number of assignments they have signed up for (and have not yet been awarded). The grid will populate with the assignments that the employees qualify for which may not correlate with the number of assignments they have signed up for. To begin the process, click on the first employee on the list. Please note that you cannot click on an employee that has not been officially awarded an assignment or skipped. Please note that the process will prioritize full signups over partial signups. For example, if the first employee on the list has zero full signups and the second employee on the list has full sign ups, the one with the full signups will be awarded the assignment first before the system will process the partial signups of any of the employees. The following define the action buttons available for the Award Open Shifts by Employee function: The Automatic Confirmation Not Required Button The Automatic Confirmation Not Required Button will process the entire list and skip through employees that have not signed up to an assignment or no longer qualify for an assignment (awarded and closed by an employee higher on the list) and it will automatically award employees to their first priority assignment that they qualify for. You will be asked to confirm that you want to continue with the process. Click OK to continue. A notification will appear once the process is complete. The grid will represent the recorded responses for the process. The Automatic Confirmation Required Button The Automatic Confirmation Required button will process the employee list and skip through employees that have not signed up to an assignment or no longer qualify for an assignment (awarded and closed by an employee higher on the list) BUT it will stop processing on employees that have signed up to and qualify for assignments and require a manual response action from the user awarding the open shift assignments. Once the Automatic Confirmation Required button is enabled, it will change to the Turn OFF Automatic Confirmation Required button which will disable the automatic function if clicked. The process will skip through employees that do not have sign ups and/or do not qualify for assignments, but will stop at employees who have signed up for and qualify for assignments. Select the assignment to award the employee (if not manually skipping them) and select the payment and time information to award to the selected employee. In the Pay Type drop-down menu, select the appropriate pay type to award the employee for the assignment. Use the Date Pickers in the Times section to award the specified time to the employee. When awarding an open shift, you can award the employee for the entire shift or for a part of the shift. You can use the time pickers to select the start and end times to manually award to the selected employee. Please note that you can award part of the shift. The shift will remain open until all times of the assignment have been assigned. Please note that the Open Times column will represent the times available for the assignment and the Signup Times column will represent the times that the employee has signed up for."

You will be able to go back and edit your design later if you so choose. You must save your work before exiting the custom report writer screen for any reason – failure to do so will result in the loss of any or all of your progress. o The option to Delete your design. If you would like to start re-building your custom report from scratch, click the delete button. o The option to Copy your design. If you would like to make a duplicate of your custom report once you have finished creating it, click the copy button.

If yes is selected, this means that the name of your custom report will be displayed when the final report is produced. o From the Report Category drop-down menu, you will have the option of selecting the subject matter of your custom report. The categories are as follows: Bank Balance Employee Extra Duty Overtime Payroll Roster Scheduling Time and Attendance Time Off • Once you have chosen a category, the lower half of the screen will populate, giving you the ability to further build and specify the data of your report. • It is important to build the foundation or skeleton of your report before building out the finite details. In this next section, we will go over adding rows and columns. Building a Foundation Begin building the foundation of your report by adding columns and column names. • In the Grid Toolbox section, type in the name of a column you would like to add. In our example, we will be adding the columns, Employee Code, Employee Name, Date, and Reason. • Once you have typed in the name of your column, click Add. It will then appear in the field labeled, Grid Design Layout. • If you would like to alter the order in which your columns appear, you can do so by clicking the column number (Note: not the name of the column, but the number appearing above it, i.e. “Column 4”) and dragging it to the desired slot, appearing in purple. • You can also alter the order of your columns by clicking the column number, and then clicking the Move Column button that appears at the bottom of your screen in the Cell Details field. This action will move your column one slot to the right. Repeatedly clicking will move your column one slot to the right again, and so forth. • You can now begin building the rows of your custom report by clicking Add Rows. This will populate in the Grid Design Layout field. You may click this multiple times to add multiple rows. o Under the Process drop-down menu, you will see a varying list of options you can use to populate your rows. o Find the process that best matches the desired data set of the column. Once selected, this will produce a further list of fields to choose from. Click on the appropriate field for your column and drag that field into the grid box to which it belongs. o Repeat this process with the remaining empty fields, choosing different processes when needed, until you have completed the row. o NOTE: It is very important to remember to Update Your Cells as your are building your report – otherwise, your changes will not be saved. After making changes to a cell or multiple cells, be sure to click on the cells you have changed and then click Update Cell at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. Cell Details When clicking on an individual cell, you will notice that a Cell Details field appears at the bottom of the screen. In this section, some examples of the purpose and functions of the cell details field will be described. • To get started specifying your cell details, begin by clicking on a cell. In this example, we will be working with the cells, Employee - Full Name, and Time Off Entry - Date, beginning with Employee – Full Name. • Once clicked, the cell details field will appear at the bottom of your screen. It is important to note that this field will contain different information depending on what information the cell is currently populated with. o Section 1: In this section, you have the option to select a filter through which the employee selection will be processed when running your report. If you would like to add a filter, click Add Employee Filter, which will produce a drop-down menu. Use the drop-down menu to specify which filter you would like to use. In this scenario, some employee filter options include using only active employees, using only full-time employees, and only using employees who have a processed time sheet. In this example, we will be filtering the report to display only Active Employees. You may add more than one filter by clicking the Add Employee Filter button once more and repeating the process detailed above. If you would like to remove a filter, click the red minus symbol that appears to the right of the drop-down menu. o Section 2: In this section, you will see the Value and Description fields. The value field indicates which value you previously selected to populate the cell. The detail field provides a brief description of the information that specific cell will return once your final report is run. Again, the information displayed in these fields will vary depending on which cell you have clicked. o Section 3: The Group Entire Row Based on This Cell’s Value option, if the Yes option is checked, will produce that cell’s information across the entire row of your final report once it is run. o Section 4: The Delete Col # action allows you to delete whatever column you have currently selected. o Remember to Update Your Cell once you have set your cell preferences – this will save any changes you have made. • We will now be looking at the cell details field for the Time Off Entry – Date cell. o Section 1: This section details your Data Source. The Data Source simply refers to what source the report is pulling the information from to use to when running the final report. Use the drop-down menu to select your data source – in this scenario, we will be using Date. o Section 2: This section allows you to choose and specify various optional filters for your cell data. Use the drop-down menu to select an initial filter. Use the next drop-down menu to further specify the qualifying factor of your filter. Examples of these include “is equal to”, “is less than”, “is less than or equal to”, “is greater than”, etc. These statements add an additional exclusionary level to your filter. In this example we will use “is less than or equal to”. Use the text box to type in your specification. You will next have the option of adding a conditional And or Or statement. This option adds another layer of specification to your filter by giving you the ability to include a second point of qualification to the data that will be produced. o Remember to Update Your Cell once you have set your cell preferences – this will save any changes you have made. • Build out the remaining rows and cells of your report by following in the steps detailed above, until you have a complete custom report. Running a Custom Report To run a custom report, take the following steps: • Log into your web portal account using administrative credentials. • Click the Reports tab. • Under the Custom Reports submenu, click Run a Custom Report. The Run a Custom Report screen will appear. • Click on Select Report using the drop-down menu. • Define Your Filters by specifying: o The date range in which you would like to run the report o The employees for whom you would like to run the report o The reasons for which you would like to run the report • Click Search."

In this scenario, an employee’s first year is completed with the new year (usually January). For example, an employee hired in January 2016 will receive a certain monthly allotment until their January 2017 when they are considered to be in their second year. And an employee hired in December 2016 will then receive the second year (or January 2017) allotment as they will be considered to have completed their first year by January 1st. The Setup Monthly Allotment • In the Year field, type in 1 to represent the first year that the employee is in. The employee’s first day would be considered as in year 1. • In the Allotted field, type in the amount of time (in the unit hours/day in which the time bank is created) that the employee will receive monthly. • (Usually not applicable and set to zero) The Max Times field will set a limit to how many times an employee will receive the rules. If for example you set your rules so that employees receive a monthly allotment for the entire year, but you set the Max Times field to 1, then the employee will only receive the first allotment before the system terminates the process. For this scenario, you can set this field to zero. • The Frequency field determines the repetition of the allotment. Set this field to Monthly to represent a monthly allotment. • In the Day field, select the day of every month that the employees will receive an allotment. In this example, the allotment is set for the first of each month. If setting this up for the last day of the month, then we suggest that you use the 28th in order to avoid missed allotments for months that do not contain above 28 days. • In the Step Effective field, select Month for this example, as the system will use this field to process when the rules should take effect for the employees. In this example, it is after one month. Allotment after the New Year • The next step in the allotment occurs once the new year begins (not necessarily meaning that the employee has completed one year since their hire date). • In the Year field, type in 2 to specify that this rule is for employees entering their second year (with the new year, not with the employee’s anniversary hire date). • In the Allotted field, type in the amount that the employees will receive for the year. • (Usually not applicable and set to zero) The Max Times field will set a limit to how many times an employee will receive the rules. If for example you set your rules so that employees receive a monthly allotment for the entire year, but you set the Max Times field to 1, then the employee will only receive the first allotment before the system terminates the process. For this scenario, you can set this field to zero. • The Frequency field determines the repetition of the allotment. For this example, set this field to January for the allotment to only occur once in the year in January. • In the Day field, type in the date in January that the employees will receive the allotment. • In the Step Effective field, select the mm/dd option and type in 12/31. The system will use this field to process when the rules should take effect for the employees. In this example, it is after 12/31 (the new year). • Click on Save to save the allotted days off rules. • Please review employees’ Pay Info profiles to ensure that they are assigned to a Work Group. Scenario #2 – Anniversary by Anniversary Date A newly hired employee receives a certain amount of time per month until they have completed a year as per their accrual date, then they accrue a different amount starting their second year (after completing one year from their hire date). The image below illustrates how to set up the specific scenario for the allotted days off by step rules. The Setup Monthly Allotment • In the Year field, type in 1 to represent the first year that the employee is in. The employee’s first day would be considered as in year 1. • In the Allotted field, type in the amount of time (in the unit hours/day in which the time bank is created) that the employee will receive monthly. • (Usually not applicable and set to zero) The Max Times field will set a limit to how many times an employee will receive the rules. If for example you set your rules so that employees receive a monthly allotment for the entire year, but you set the Max Times field to 1, then the employee will only receive the first allotment before the system terminates the process. For this scenario, you can set this field to zero. • The Frequency field determines the repetition of the allotment. Set this field to Monthly to represent a monthly allotment. • In the Day field, select the day of every month that the employees will receive an allotment. In this example, the allotment is set for the first of each month. If setting this up for the last day of the month, then we suggest that you use the 28th in order to avoid missed allotments for months that do not contain above 28 days. • In the Step Effective field, select Month for this example, as the system will use this field to process when the rules should take effect for the employees. In this example, it is after one month. Allotment after the New Year • The next step in the allotment occurs the employee has completed one year since their hire date. • In the Year field, type in 2 to specify that this rule is for employees entering their second year. • In the Allotted field, type in the amount that the employees will receive for the year. • (Usually not applicable and set to zero) The Max Times field will set a limit to how many times an employee will receive the rules. If for example you set your rules so that employees receive a monthly allotment for the entire year, but you set the Max Times field to 1, then the employee will only receive the first allotment before the system terminates the process.

For this example, set this field to January for the allotment to only occur once in the year in January. • In the Day field, type in the date in January that the employees will receive the allotment. • In the Step Effective field, select the Anniversary. The system will use this field to process when the rules should take effect for the employees. In this example, it is after the anniversary of their hire date. • Click on Save to save the allotted days off rules. • Please review employees’ Pay Info profiles to ensure that they are assigned to a Work Group.

The following settings reflect VCS recommended privilege settings for Basic User security profiles. Please use these settings as a guide to help create and troubleshoot the security settings that would appropriately reflect your departmental policies. Please note that for these user settings, you may need to create custom privileges for specific items (such as Daily Schedule and other schedule view related items) to grant users rights, to those items, that deviate from the default settings. Please refer to the “Adding Specific Custom Privileges to Objects and Items” and “Specific Custom Privileges for the Basic User Security Profile” sections in this document for directions on adding specific custom privileges to specific items and a list of the recommended items for the Basic User security profile. Recommended Security Settings for Supervisors Administrators should configure security privileges for their users in the best way that corresponds to their departmental policies and needs. The following settings reflect VCS recommended privilege settings for Supervisor level security profiles.

The following settings reflect VCS recommended privilege settings for Administrative security profiles. Please use these settings as a guide to help create and troubleshoot the security settings that would appropriately reflect your departmental policies. Administrators typically have the most rights to screens and functions in the scheduling system. There is a ‘Security Administrator’ option in the Setup Security screen that when checked for the Administrative security profile will grant those users all of the items (functions and screens) in the scheduling system and complete access to all privileges (access to actions such as viewing, approving, etc.). If you check the ‘Security Administrator’ option, the Update Items button will disable because granting administrative rights to a security profile ensures that that security profile will have access to all the items in the scheduling system. The default privileges do not need to be set for this case because the ‘Security Administrator’ option will grant the selected security profile with access to all functions and users in the system. Adding Specific Custom Privileges to Objects and Items You will want to modify specific privileges for specific items on certain security profiles to allow users to have rights that differ from their default privilege setting rights for certain screens and functions. For example, for Basic Users, who may only have rights set up to view only their own information, you may want to create a specific custom privilege for the ‘Daily Schedule’ item so that they can view other employees on the daily schedule. To set custom privileges for certain items, follow these steps: • In the ‘Setup Security’ screen, click on (to select) the security profile to which you want to modify an item to add a custom privilege • Click on Update Items The ‘Update Items’ screen will appear To create custom privileges for specific objects/items, follow these steps: • Click on (to select) the item for which you want to create a specific custom privilege (please note that an item must already be added and saved to a security profile in order for the Add Custom Privilege button to enable) • Click on the Pencil icon You will be brought to the ‘Employee Ledger’ screen for that specific item. Once you have configured the necessary specific custom privilege for the specific item, click on Save Custom Privilege to save the changes. Specific Custom Privileges for the Basic User Security Profile Administrators should configure security privileges for their users in the best way that corresponds to their departmental policies and needs. The following settings reflect VCS recommended item specific custom privilege settings for Basic User security profiles. Please use these settings as a guide to help create and troubleshoot the security settings that would appropriately reflect your departmental policies. The following are the recommended specific custom privilege settings for specific items that may be assigned to the Basic User security profile. The items to which you may want to add a specific custom privilege include: • Schedule Overtime • Switch Request • Daily Schedule • Monthly Schedule Grid • Monthly Schedule • Open Shifts • Weekly Schedule"

    "Body": "Setup AION offers integration with either Zoom or GoToMeeting. This integration enables the user to create, edit and manage online meetings. In order to utilize this integration, the user must setup the two following items: Setting Default Online Meeting Application (System-wide) The user can select either Zoom or GoToMeeting as their default online meeting application to be used anywhere within AION. It is strongly encouraged that the selected meeting application does not change as historical meetings linked to a no longer used application will not be accessible. The selected application will be used throughout AION for all online meeting functionality. Click on Setup. In the Company submenu , click on Setup Company. In the Other Controls panel, select either \"None\", \"Zoom\", or \"GoToMeeting\" in Online Meeting Default Application. Click Save when finished. Setting Meeting Application Email The user must set the email address that is used to login to their Zoom or GoToMeeting account within AION. This is required to ensure successful integration with either meeting application in addition to enabling AION to automatically refresh the connection to the meeting application for the correct user so the user does not have to login to Zoom or GoToMeeting every use within AION. Storing the user's account email also offers flexibility as their meeting application email could be different from their regular email used in other AION features and functions. This email is only used to ensure proper connection with Zoom or GoToMeeting; AION does not use this email for any other purpose and this information is always safely securely. Online meetings cannot be utilized without an associated email stored in AION to link to either Zoom or GoToMeeting. Click on Employee. In the My Settings submenu, click on Update My Information. In the Online Meeting Settings, enter the account's email in Zoom - Email Tied To Account or GoToMeeting - Email Tied To Account depending on which meeting application default was selected from the above section. This should be the email address used by the user when logging in to either Zoom or GoToMeeting. Click Save when finished. Connecting to Zoom or GoToMeeting If the user has never connected to either Zoom or GoToMeeting within AION before, the user must authenticate themselves to retrieve connection information that is stored within AION to allow automatic refreshes of expired connections so that the user will only ever have to log in to Zoom or GoToMeeting once to utilize online meeting functionality within AION.

The user will be redirected to the application's site requesting user credentials. These credentials should be filled out and authorization terms accepted. Once logged in and authenticated, the user will be redirected back to My Meetings. The access button should no longer appear, and instead, a Create Meeting button should be visible in it's place. A connection record will now exist for the email and application type set up in in previous section.

This has been done to reflect the fact that schedule views and dashboards are inherently built on the same core functionality and are being conceptually merged into one feature. Within the new Dashboards menu, you will now see a \"Schedule\" sub-menu that contains all the screens from the the old Today's Schedule menu, as well as a \"Custom\" sub-menu that contains the new Dashboard Profile manager screen. The \"Setup Schedule Profiles\" screen within the Setup->Display menu has been replaced with a \"Setup Dashboard Profiles\" item that takes you to the Dashboard Profile manager. There is no security setting available for this item, meaning it will always be available to all users. This keeps it consistent with the security of the overall Dashboards module, which is also always available to all users. There will be a Classic Dashboards menu available to Maverick users for a limited time after they are migrated to the new system. This menu will retain all the same functionality and screens as the old Dashboards menu. The new Dashboard Profiles screen is available to be selected as a user's homepage if they choose.

[Choose Replacement Policy] Simple Mode: Click on the employee list, then choose a sort property. Advanced Mode: Click on \"Advanced,\" then select the rule group you want to apply (pre-programmed for consistency). [Run the Search] After selecting the appropriate rule group, click Search. This will display the list of employees and show how many jobs are left to fill (e.g., 4 jobs left). [Choose Processing Mode] Automatic Confirmation Required: This mode stops at each employee who has a signup that can be fulfilled during the timeframe. You can accept, deny, or excuse each employee. Automatic Confirmation Not Required: The system automatically awards jobs to employees based on their signups and sort order without stopping. [Manage Excuses] Use the \"excused\" option if you want to manually exclude an employee from the process, which can place them at the bottom of the list based on settings. [Run the Process] Start the process with Automatic Confirmation Required. The system will run through employees in order, stopping for each person with available jobs. When stopping on each employee (e.g., Andrew, Mark), you'll decide whether to accept, deny, or excuse the job based on their preferences (like payment type or hours). [Handling Employees with No Full Signups] The system will skip employees with no full signups and come back to them on a second pass for partial signups. [Partial Signups] After the first pass of full signups, the system will look at partial signups. For example, Ryan has both a full and a partial signup. You can adjust his hours if necessary (e.g., Ryan requested 1:00 AM to 6:00 AM, so you adjust and accept). [Review Open Shifts] After the system finishes awarding jobs, you'll see the number of jobs filled and any open shifts remaining. For example, Ryan's partial shift is still open for signups. [Fill Remaining Shifts] If there are remaining open shifts (like Ryan's), you can either manually fill them or run the award process again after giving employees more time to sign up. Review and Finalize Go back to the Award Open Shifts screen to review which jobs are filled and which are still partially open. You can fill any remaining shifts from here."

Step 2: Check Notification Center and Banners: In the Notifications settings for the app, make sure to select your alert style (Banners or Alerts) and choose \"Persistent\" for banners if you want them to stay on the screen until dismissed. Step 3: Ensure Do Not Disturb is Off: Go to Settings > Focus > Do Not Disturb. Make sure it's turned off or customize it to allow notifications from specific contacts/apps even when it's active. Step 4: Enable Background App Refresh: Go to Settings> General > Background App Refresh and make sure it’s turned on for the apps you want notifications from. Step 5: Check your Internet Connection: Ensure your device has a stable internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data) as notifications require this to be delivered. Step 6: Update iOS: Keep your iOS updated to the latest version by going to Settings > General > Software Update. Step 7: Restart Your iPhone: Sometimes a simple restart can fix notification issues. Step 8: Log out and back into the VCS Workforce Management or Jobs4Blue App This will ensure all settings and server connections are current. By following these steps, you should be able to receive push notifications consistently on your iPhone. If you continue to experience issues, consider reinstalling the app to refresh its notifications. Android Device Push Message Configuration: Configuring push notifications on a Samsung Galaxy phone is not significantly different from configuring them on any other Android device. The main steps involve ensuring that your phone's settings allow notifications to come through, especially for specific apps such as the VCS Workforce Management and Jobs4Blue Mobile apps, and that push notifications are enabled for these apps. Here’s how to configure and manage push notifications on a Samsung Galaxy phone: Step 1: Enable Push Notifications for Apps Swipe down from the top of the screen to access the Quick Settings menu and tap the Settings gear. Alternatively, go to Apps and tap Settings. Scroll down and select Apps (or Applications depending on your device version). Find and select the app you want to receive push notifications from. Tap on Notifications. Ensure that \"Allow Notifications\" is turned ON. If this is disabled, you won’t receive any push notifications for this app. If needed, you can customize notification settings for the app like sound, vibration, pop-up notifications, or priority settings. Step 2: Configure System-Wide Notification Settings Go to Settings > Notifications: Turn on/off Do Not Disturb mode. Choose how notifications are shown (on the lock screen, as banners, etc.). Under the Do Not Disturb section, you can ensure that you don't miss notifications by allowing exceptions for specific apps or contacts. You can choose whether notifications should be shown on the lock screen, as banners, or as icons in the status bar. Under Settings > Sounds and Vibration > Notification Sounds, you can set up sounds for notifications, including push notifications from apps. Step 3: Check Battery Settings to Avoid Blocking Notifications Samsung Galaxy phones have Battery Optimization features that might block or delay push notifications. Go to Settings > Battery and Device Care > Battery. Tap on Background usage limits and check for any apps that may be restricted. You can disable any background restrictions for apps that should receive push notifications. Make sure apps you want notifications from are allowed to run in the background without being put to sleep or limited by battery optimization. Step 4: Check Network Settings (Optional) Push notifications require an active network connection, either Wi-Fi or mobile data. If notifications aren’t being received: Check Wi-Fi or Mobile Data: Ensure that your device is connected to the internet. Clear Network Cache: If you're facing connectivity issues, try clearing the network cache in Settings > General Management > Reset > Reset Network Settings. Step 5: Update Apps and Software Ensure your apps and phone software are up to date for the best notification experience: Go to the Google Play Store or Galaxy Store, tap Menu (three lines) and go to My apps & games to update any apps that have pending updates. Go to Settings > Software Update and check for any available updates for your Samsung Galaxy phone. Step 6: Turn Off Battery Saver Mode (Optional) Battery Saver can limit notifications, so make sure it’s turned off if you're having issues: Go to Settings > Battery and Device Care > Battery > Power Saving Mode. Disable Power Saving Mode if it’s enabled. By following these steps, you should be able to configure and enable push notifications on your Samsung Galaxy phone. If you're having trouble receiving notifications for a particular app, double-check the app’s settings and ensure that background data is not restricted."
